I am building [Touca] to help software engineers find the unintended side-effects
of their daily code changes on the behavior and performance of their product.

Before Touca, I was a senior software engineer at Canon Medical Informatics
building software for advanced visualization of medical images. Before that,
I was a software engineer at VMware Carbon Black.

I am interested in problems related to the design and maintenance of software
at scale and over time. I am passionate about solutions to improve stability
and maintainability of products with large ever-changing codebases.

If you ever wanted to chat, I am pretty easy to find and talk to.
