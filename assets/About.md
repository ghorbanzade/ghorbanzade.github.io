# Hey, I'm Pejman

I am building [Weasel], a continuous regression testing solution for critical
software workflows. It helps engineering teams quickly identify the impact of
any code change on the behavior or performance of their product, and
collaborate with each other to review and approve of that impact.

Before Weasel, I was a senior software engineer at Vital Images Inc, a
Canon Medical Group company, leading the medical imaging informatics
industry. Before that, I used to work at Carbon Black, now part of VMware.

I am interested in problems related to the design and maintenance of
software at scale and over time. Specifically, I am passionate about
solutions to improve stability and maintainability of products with
large ever-changing codebases. Naturally, I love to learn about techniques
to refactor and test non-trivial applications.

If you ever wanted to chat, feel free to send me an email or tweet at me.
