# Hey, I'm Pejman

I am a software engineer at Vital Images, Inc., a Canon Group company,
leading the medical imaging informatics industry. I am part of the
engineering team responsible for development of Vitrea Advanced Visualization
software which is used by medical professionals and surgical specialists
across the globe for clinical analysis and therapy planning.
I take pride in what I do during the day. It is not always fun, but it makes
a small positive impact in the health of people around the world.

I am mostly interested in problems related to the design and maintenance of
software at scale and over time. Specifically, I am passionate about
solutions to improve stability and maintainability of products with
large ever-changing codebases. Naturally, I love to learn about techniques
to refactor and test non-trivial applications.

At nights and during weekends, I work on a side project: An end-to-end
distributed regression testing solution for arbitrary execution workflows.
It helps engineering teams quickly identify the impact of any code change
on the behavior of their product, and collaborate with each other to review
and approve of that impact. I plan to launch it early next year.

If you ever wanted to chat, feel free to send me an email or tweet at me.
I am always up for grabbing a virtual coffee.
